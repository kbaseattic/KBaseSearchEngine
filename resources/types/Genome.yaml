# This specification describes how a Workspace Genome object is transformed into a document that is
# indexed by the KBaseSeachEngine.

# The name of the type in the search system.
global-object-type: Genome
# The data source of the objects, in this case the Workspace.
storage-type: WS
# The name of the type in the data source.
storage-object-type: KBaseGenomes.Genome

# The following rules describe which fields are extracted from the source object and transforms
# performed upon said fields.
indexing-rules:
    -
        # Extract a string from the /id path. The key name will be id.
        path: id

        # Extract a full-text search field from the /taxonomy path. A full-text field is parsed
        # into tokens which can be searched on individually, as opposed to a string field which is
        # an opaque block and must be matched in its entirety.
        # The key name will be taxonomy.
        path: taxonomy

        # Extract the number of features from a list at the /features path. The special {size}
        # element directs the parser to return the size of a list or mapping. Since this number
        # will be an integer, the keyword type is set as such.
        # The key name is explicitly set to features, rather than implicitly set by the first
        # section of the path.

        # must match the key name of another indexing rule in this spec that produces a GUID.
